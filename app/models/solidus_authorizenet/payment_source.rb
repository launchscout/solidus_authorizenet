  # AuthorizeNet Payment Source
  #
  # This source is keeping information about an actual initial payment and
  # then later updated with an authorize net customer id when payment was
  # approved.
  #
  # It works together with AuthorizeNet's accept.js solution, so initiatlly
  # it is seeded with a data_value and data_descriptor. This is used to
  # create a customer and a payment profile within Authorize Net.
  #
  # Whent he payment profile is created correctly this source is updated
  # with the customer id from AuthorizeNet.
  #
  # This customer id is then used as payment profile within AuthorizeNet
  # for authorize, capturing, voiding and refunding.
